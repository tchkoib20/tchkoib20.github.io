        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals provide a powerful aspiration for improving our world — laying out where we collectively need to go and how to get there.</p>

        <h2>The SDGs Explained for Business</h2>

        <p>In September 2015, all 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted a plan for achieving a better future for all — laying out a path over the next 15 years to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet. At the heart of “Agenda 2030” are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which clearly define the world we want — applying to all nations and leaving no one behind.</p>
